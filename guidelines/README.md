# Template Application Coding Guidelines

## Background

These guidelines have been authored with the following things in mind:

**consistency**
All code should be formatted and written the same way

**maintainability**
Having automated tests to check the main functionality of the application allows us to keep apps up-to-date

**pluggability** 
By keeping a consistent application format and a minimum consistent set of dependencies means developer can more easily combine different applications

**contribution-friendliness*
Every template/application should be friendly to new contirbutors to allow to fix bugs or add missing features.

## Guidelines

With these criteria in mind we came up with the following guidelines:

- [Node.js](NODE_JS.md)
